              <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>Brought to the UK as a child my passion for drawing had me drawing portraits from an early age. When my parents returned to Nigeria, I found myself doing a fine Art degree with specialization in graphics as it was then called. I still made portraits but opted for commercial art. I started work as a traditional graphic Artist in the analogue sense but was quick to adopt digital at a time when it was not very popular. After Graduating with a degree in Graphics I worked in one of the largest printing presses in west Africa called Academy press where I became familiar with the print reproductive process. I then moved into advertising where I worked for several advertising agencies and became a Creative director. My exposure at Academy press gave me access to the earliest versions of Mac and I was designing magazines for print at a time when cut and paste was still the norm. This meant I have been using Adobe and early version of most contemporary Mac software from their initial or original versions.
                </p>
                <p>As major Print equipment manufacturers became eager to promote their digital print equipment, I was head hunted by Heidelberg Germany to promote their products in West Africa selling supporting and training end users in the use of Drum scanners imagesetter and digital printing machines. Even though I had left creatives for technical support I never stopped using graphics software in my spare time. I also taught print operators and designers how to effectively use of Photoshop, InDesign, and illustrator for print production in my spare time. Returning to the UK I worked for Pressteck Europe in West London as prepress technical support until direct imaging presses were gradually overtaken by newer colour print technology. One of my skills was Press to proof calibration for direct imaging presses however that is also all done digitally now. My last job in digital support was with Morgana systems who specialize in print finishing equipment. My background in workflow systems made leaning new digital software my main past time. This led me into self-taught photography and Editing with Adobe Premier, After Effects and Final Cut pro X as well as a very short stint at the Brits School in Croydon where I learnt video editing with Final Cut Pro 7 before it was superseded by FCP X.
                </p>
                <p>A bit of a workaholic my desire to always be occupied led me into freelance portrait photography and events videography on a part time basis while still working at Morgana Systems in 2013. My main interests could be described as always being eager to learning something new digitally.  I enjoy creativity in any digital form which is why UI design as a full-time job became my obvious choice after leaving technical support when it came to career change. I have always been a keen athlete and was part of my university 4 x 100 meters Relay team and so I consider myself naturally very fit.
                </p>
                <p>I have acquired a lot of new skills since I started in UI design including user research, Ideation techniques the preparation of Wireframes, visual design from a different perspective to what I have been used to but most importantly how to empathise with users and use this to enhance by ability as a designer.
