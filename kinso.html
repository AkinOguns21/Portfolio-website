            <p>From my interpretation of the brief, I was drawn to problems that users may have getting “new” ingredients for recipes that they wish to try out.
              It’s not un-common for users to run out of ingredients when trying to cook something new. Alternatives are often sought which may defeat the purpose of trying a new recipe in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>In approaching this responsive web App I explored issues relating to how users search for and approach preparing meals. This includes the absence of relevant ingredient when users want to cook something new and problems, they have trying to relate this to shopping habits.

              <h3>Research</h3>
              <p>While conducting research I considered relevant audience tasks and goals involving defining basic ingredients users have at home and how the absence of same can prove a stumbling block when making dishes. How the apps users could customise recipes with notes and favourites for future reference.
              </p>
              <p>While exploring why users would use the product, I discovered that knowing what was inside the meals was important to some users coupled with the need to save money. When asked about what mattered most to users during the research and the main actions which effect decision making. ‘What was in the fridge’, played an important part in decisions in addition to shopping practices.
              </p>
              <p>The main patterns observed from my research could be categories into Time, Presentation, Trying something new, Taste, Shopping, Ingredients and Calories. These elements served as pointers and were used in creating an affinity diagram during my brainstorming session.
