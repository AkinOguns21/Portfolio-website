            <p>From my interpretation of the brief, I was drawn to problems that users may have getting “new” ingredients for recipes that they wish to try out.
              It’s not un-common for users to run out of ingredients when trying to cook something new. Alternatives are often sought which may defeat the purpose of trying a new recipe in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>In approaching this responsive web App I explored issues relating to how users search for and approach preparing meals. This includes the absence of relevant ingredient when users want to cook something new and problems, they have trying to relate this to shopping habits.
            </p>

              <h3>Research</h3>
              <p>While conducting research I considered relevant audience tasks and goals involving defining basic ingredients users have at home and how the absence of same can prove a stumbling block when making dishes. How the apps users could customise recipes with notes and favourites for future reference.
              </p>
              <p>While exploring why users would use the product, I discovered that knowing what was inside the meals was important to some users coupled with the need to save money. When asked about what mattered most to users during the research and the main actions which effect decision making. ‘What was in the fridge’, played an important part in decisions in addition to shopping practices.
              </p>
              <p>The main patterns observed from my research could be categories into Time, Presentation, Trying something new, Taste, Shopping, Ingredients and Calories. These elements served as pointers and were used in creating an affinity diagram during my brainstorming session.

              <h3>Ideation</h3>
              <p>The data gathered from research was used to as a basis for my persona to represent a broad range of prospective users for the purposes of this specific design and for further development during later iterations of the product development. This played a large role in the formulation of the concept so that my focus was directed only at what mattered to users.
              </p>
              <p>With my MVP and user stories defined I produced user flows of essential screens making the flow of the app easier to analyse during the planning process. I then took this a bit further with Flow diagram which assisted me in seeing the skeletal framework of the responsive app and avoid bottle necks

              <p>The UI element of the responsive app design was used to produce moods boards. I chose mood board 1 because I felt it would better represent the different types of meals that would be displayed on the app.

              </picture>
              <p>Using elements from my mood board I conducted A/B Testing with fellow designers on slack and received a resounding response for one of the options in addition to valuable insight on how to improve the design from the comments of other designers.

              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <p>Rough sketches were drawn on paper using crazy 8 method to generate ideas. These rough sketches were used for the preliminary user testing to sample and get feedback on the navigational elements in the app. Mid fidelity wireframes were drawn in sketch along with the high-fidelity drawings which were used for the final mock-up’s.
